# About Pre-Golem-Alpha-0.0.0.4.0

## Name

The name is based on the Stanis≈Çaw Lem's story Golem XIV [1]. This is
obviously the ancestor of Golem XIV in the very early stages, so the
name corresponds with that fact. Numbers in the name are also the part
of the super-major versions, while you should look into the git for
the ongoing versions.

If written as one word -- "pregolem" -- it's also a Serbian regional
adjective with the meaning "extremely big".
