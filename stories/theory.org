* IN PROGRESS Towards post-structural semantic analysis
Not only contemporary programming tools and processing power allow us
to make complex linguistic and semiotic analysis, but a lot of the
methods for post-structural analysis exist for decades, as well as
many computational linguistic tools have been already implementing
post-structural methods for a while. Consequently, it's more about
putting things into the context and naming them as such than inventing
completely new tools.

It's mostly about our perspective on the matter we analyze and our
process of analysis.
